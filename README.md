Since moving to Los Angeles, Chinatown has felt like home away from home for me. LA's Chinatown is much smaller than SF/NYC's Chinatowns, but it has so many hidden gems and I've had some of my favorite food in Los Angeles here. There are lots of restaurant guides out there on food in Los Angeles, but I wanted to make a fun, centralized compilation of all of them from a text-based analytical approach.

A work in progress!
